[21:34:29] [Server thread/INFO]: Unfortunately due to the way that Minecraft implemented multiworld support in 1.6, Bukkit requires that you move your the_end folder to a new location in order to operate correctly.
[21:34:29] [Server thread/INFO]: We will move this folder for you, but it will mean that you need to move it back should you wish to stop using Bukkit in the future.
